# ðŸ“š Portfolio Study Roadmap (Prioritized)

This roadmap combines three learning paths to strengthen Machine Learning, Cloud, GPU acceleration, and Full-Stack Development skills.  
The order below reflects recommended prioritization for the fastest career impact.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Part 1 (First Priority): Machine Learning + AWS + Docker/Kubernetes

* Covers ML Engineer 1 level fundamentals  
* AWS Cloud Practitioner + AWS AI Practitioner prep  
* Intermediate Docker & Kubernetes  
* Capstone: Real-time ML Inference API deployed on AWS EKS  
* Includes review, checkpoints, and mock interview questions  

ðŸ‘‰ **Why First?** Builds directly on your ML coursework and adds productionization skills that hiring managers expect. This makes your resume job-ready fastest.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Part 2 (Second Priority): Full-Stack Development (Flask/FastAPI + React)

* Learn backend frameworks (Flask, FastAPI)  
* Build frontend skills (React.js, UI libraries, state management)  
* Database + Auth integration  
* Capstone: Full-stack ML Dashboard with user login, predictions, history logging  
* Deploy using Docker + AWS/Heroku  

ðŸ‘‰ **Why Second?** Many ML Engineer jobs want at least basic full-stack integration skills. This makes your profile more versatile for end-to-end ML application development.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Part 3 (Third Priority): NVIDIA GPU Acceleration + Certifications

* GPU acceleration concepts (CUDA, RAPIDS, PyTorch/TensorFlow on GPU)  
* Integration into ML workloads  
* NVIDIA NCA-GENL (Generalist AI Practitioner) certification prep  
* Optional specialization for deep learning, HPC, or performance-focused ML roles  

ðŸ‘‰ **Why Third?** Highly valuable but niche. Most ML Engineer roles wonâ€™t require this, but itâ€™s a strong bonus for specialized AI/HPC positions.

âœ… By completing all three study plans in this order, you will:  
- Gain end-to-end ML engineering expertise  
- Be certified in AWS and NVIDIA AI specializations  
- Build resume-ready full-stack ML applications  
- Strengthen your portfolio with real, deployable projects
